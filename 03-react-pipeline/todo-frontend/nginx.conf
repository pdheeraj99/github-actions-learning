# Nginx configuration for React SPA (Single Page Application)
# 
# Why do we need this?
# React apps use client-side routing (React Router)
# When user visits /about, we need to serve index.html
# Nginx then lets React handle the routing

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    
    # Where our built files are
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    # Handle SPA routing
    # Try to serve the file, if not found, serve index.html
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Cache static assets for better performance
    location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2)$ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;

    # Gzip compression for faster loading
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml;
